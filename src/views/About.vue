      <p>Naruto Kai is a fan project dedicated to removing filler, padding and any other executive-minded nonsense that made the Naruto animated series the mess that it is. Each episode roughly corresponds to each volume of the comic, running for about 1 and a half to 2 hours.</p>
      <p>Many people have worked on this project before me (notably including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Thekaiguy" target="_blank">u/Thekaiguy</a>) and I’ve just picked up the torch to expand on where they left off. I basically figured there were several things I could fix myself so I decided to work on my own ideal “perfect” version for the Japanese dub.</p>
      <p>What I’ve done is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Entirely re-translated most episodes that had amateur/inadequate subtitles in order to do justice to the dialogue</li>
        <li>Fixed misinterpreted lines in other translations</li>
        <li>Edited out unnecessary recaps and padding in order to service the pacing</li>
        <li>Edited in certain scenes that were added to the show to expand on and compliment the canonical content rather than just pad it out</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Any tweaks that I made to the episodes are specified in the notes below the episode name. "Sub fix" means that I've re-translated an episode's subtitles. The other few different translations in the series were fine, so I didn't bother tweaking them. I still don't consider them perfect due to issues such as over-simplistic dialogue, odd and awkward phrasing, and overly edgy swearing, but they're definitely watchable.</p>
      <p>On that note, it's worth saying that this edit isn't perfect. I'm just one guy with a busy life who took on a big hobby, which was also worked on by other people with busy lives. My subs have the occassional spelling mistake, some stuff isn't translated as well as it could be, I forgot to cut some stuff out, etc. This is most apparent in the first few episodes but after that I more or less found my feet. Please keep in mind that though some things could be better, me and everyone else who worked on this fan edit put in many hours of work for free, because we just really love this show and we want it to be the best that we can make it.</p>
